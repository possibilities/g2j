# g2j

sync issues between github <-> jira

# summary

quick and dirty syncing of github and jira issues. right now we just copy unsync'd issues from gh to a new issue is jira, tag it with a url back to the GH issue and leave it alone.

## todo

make it more robust: copy comments over as they come in
